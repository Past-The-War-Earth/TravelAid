# TravelAid

Orignally named Urarun this App (as is now apparent) will (among other things) provide a heads up navigation display of where to go what what to do there.

Urarun was the first conceived though not implemented App in PTWE stack. It was intended for recoding and using directions and hits for travel vacations.  Now it has found it's initial and most important purpose in [NLNM simulations](https://github.com/Past-The-War-Earth/NLNM-combat-simulation/issues/1) as a way-pointing and task assignment-n-display App (quickly and effectively showing simulation participants where to go what to do, via terrain overlaying the simulated AR displays).
